<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow (Assistant Research Fellow) in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, working under the supervision of Professor Qionghai Dai. I received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2024.

I am dedicated to the interdisciplinary frontier of **AI for Astronomy** and **Computational Astronomical Imaging**, focusing on mitigating fundamental physical problems such as optical aberration, atmospheric turbulence, and photon noise. My research vision is to architect AI-powered instruments for next-generation observational astronomy. My work has been featured as first-author publications in *Nature*, *Science*, and *Nature Photonics*. I am also serving as a reviewer for *Nature*, *IEEE TCSVT*, *Optica*, *Scientific Reports* and *Optics Express*. Now, I'm serving as an Executive Editor for the special issue 'Intelligent Optical Astronomical Observation Technology' in *Laser & Optoelectronics Progress*.

[**Abstract**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Turbulence is a complex and chaotic state of fluid motion. **Atmospheric turbulence** within the Earth’s atmosphere poses fundamental challenges for applications such as remote sensing, free-space optical communications and astronomical observation due to its rapid evolution across temporal and spatial scales. Conventional methods for studying atmospheric turbulence face hurdles in capturing the wide-field distribution of turbulence due to its transparency and **anisoplanatism**. Here we develop **a light-field-based plug-and-play wide-field wavefront sensor (WWS)**, facilitating the direct observation of atmospheric turbulence over **1,100 arcsec** at 30 Hz. The experimental measurements agreed with the von Kármán turbulence model, further verified using a differential image motion monitor. Attached to an 80 cm telescope, our WWS enables clear turbulence profiling of three layers below an altitude of 750 m and high-resolution aberration-corrected imaging without additional deformable mirrors. The WWS also enables prediction of the evolution of turbulence dynamics within **33 ms** using a convolutional recurrent neural network with wide-field measurements, leading to more accurate pre-compensation of turbulence-induced errors during free-space optical communication. Wide-field sensing of dynamic turbulence wavefronts provides new opportunities for studying the evolution of turbulence in the broad field of atmospheric optics.
