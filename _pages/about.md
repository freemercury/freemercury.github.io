<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow (Assistant Research Fellow) in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, working under the supervision of Professor Qionghai Dai. I received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2024.

I am dedicated to the interdisciplinary frontier of **AI for Astronomy** and **Computational Astronomical Imaging**, focusing on mitigating fundamental physical problems such as optical aberration, atmospheric turbulence, and photon noise. My research vision is to architect AI-powered instruments for next-generation observational astronomy. My work has been featured as first-author publications in *Nature*, *Science*, and *Nature Photonics*. I am also serving as a reviewer for *Nature*, *IEEE TCSVT*, *Optica*, *Scientific Reports* and *Optics Express*. Now, I'm serving as an Executive Editor for the special issue 'Intelligent Optical Astronomical Observation Technology' in *Laser & Optoelectronics Progress*.

- Turbulence is a complex and chaotic state of fluid motion. **Atmospheric turbulence** within the Earth’s atmosphere poses fundamental challenges for applications such as remote sensing, free-space optical communications and astronomical observation due to its rapid evolution across temporal and spatial scales. Conventional methods for studying atmospheric turbulence face hurdles in capturing the wide-field distribution of turbulence due to its transparency and **anisoplanatism**. Here we develop **a light-field-based plug-and-play wide-field wavefront sensor (WWS)**, facilitating the direct observation of atmospheric turbulence over **1,100 arcsec** at 30 Hz. The experimental measurements agreed with the von Kármán turbulence model, further verified using a differential image motion monitor. Attached to an 80 cm telescope, our WWS enables clear turbulence profiling of three layers below an altitude of 750 m and high-resolution aberration-corrected imaging without additional deformable mirrors. The WWS also enables prediction of the evolution of turbulence dynamics within **33 ms** using a convolutional recurrent neural network with wide-field measurements, leading to more accurate pre-compensation of turbulence-induced errors during free-space optical communication. Wide-field sensing of dynamic turbulence wavefronts provides new opportunities for studying the evolution of turbulence in the broad field of atmospheric optics.

- Planar digital image sensors facilitate broad applications in a wide range of areas, and the number of pixels has scaled up rapidly in recent years. However, the practical performance of imaging systems is fundamentally limited by spatially nonuniform optical aberrations originating from imperfect lenses or environmental disturbances. Here we propose an **integrated scanning light-field imaging sensor**, termed a **meta-imaging sensor**, to achieve high-speed aberration-corrected three-dimensional photography for universal applications without additional hardware modifications. Instead of directly detecting a two-dimensional intensity projection, the meta-imaging sensor captures extra-fine four-dimensional light-field distributions through a vibrating coded microlens array, enabling flexible and precise synthesis of complex-field-modulated images in post-processing. Using the sensor, we achieve high-performance photography up to a **gigapixel with a single spherical lens** without a data prior, leading to **orders-of-magnitude reductions in system capacity and costs for optical imaging**. Even in the presence of dynamic atmosphere turbulence, the meta-imaging sensor enables multisite aberration correction across **1,000 arcseconds on an 80-centimetre ground-based telescope** without reducing the acquisition speed, paving the way for high-resolution synoptic sky surveys. Moreover, high-density accurate depth maps can be retrieved simultaneously, facilitating diverse applications from autonomous driving to industrial inspections.
