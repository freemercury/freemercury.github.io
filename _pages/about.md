<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow (Assistant Research Fellow) in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, working under the supervision of Professor Qionghai Dai. I received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2024.

I am dedicated to the interdisciplinary frontier of **AI for Astronomy** and **Computational Astronomical Imaging**, focusing on mitigating fundamental physical problems such as **optical aberration**, **atmospheric turbulence**, and **photon noise**. My research vision is to architect **AI-powered instruments** for **Next-generation Observational Astronomy**. My work has been featured as first-author publications in *Nature*, *Science*, and *Nature Photonics*. 

I am also serving as a reviewer for *Nature*, *IEEE TCSVT*, *Optica*, *Scientific Reports* and *Optics Express*. Now, I'm serving as an Executive Editor for the special issue 'Intelligent Optical Astronomical Observation Technology' in *Laser & Optoelectronics Progress*.

[Direct observation of atmospheric turbulence with a video-rate wide-field wavefront sensor](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01466-3)

- we develop **a light-field-based plug-and-play wide-field wavefront sensor (WWS)**, facilitating the direct observation of atmospheric turbulence over **1,100 arcsec** at 30 Hz. The experimental measurements agreed with the von Kármán turbulence model, further verified using a differential image motion monitor. Attached to an 80 cm telescope, our WWS enables clear turbulence profiling of three layers below an altitude of 750 m and high-resolution aberration-corrected imaging without additional deformable mirrors. The WWS also enables prediction of the evolution of turbulence dynamics within **33 ms** using a convolutional recurrent neural network with wide-field measurements, leading to more accurate pre-compensation of turbulence-induced errors during free-space optical communication. Wide-field sensing of dynamic turbulence wavefronts provides new opportunities for studying the evolution of turbulence in the broad field of atmospheric optics.

[An integrated ima ging sensor for aberration-corrected 3D photography](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05306-8)

[**Abstract**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=VaGAePwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=VaGAePwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='VaGAePwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC'></span></strong>


- We propose an **integrated scanning light-field imaging sensor**, termed a **meta-imaging sensor**, to achieve high-speed aberration-corrected three-dimensional photography for universal applications without additional hardware modifications. Instead of directly detecting a two-dimensional intensity projection, the meta-imaging sensor captures extra-fine four-dimensional light-field distributions through a vibrating coded microlens array, enabling flexible and precise synthesis of complex-field-modulated images in post-processing. Using the sensor, we achieve high-performance photography up to a **gigapixel with a single spherical lens** without a data prior, leading to **orders-of-magnitude reductions in system capacity and costs for optical imaging**. Even in the presence of dynamic atmosphere turbulence, the meta-imaging sensor enables multisite aberration correction across **1,000 arcseconds on an 80-centimetre ground-based telescope** without reducing the acquisition speed, paving the way for high-resolution synoptic sky surveys. Moreover, high-density accurate depth maps can be retrieved simultaneously, facilitating diverse applications from autonomous driving to industrial inspections.
